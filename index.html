            <h2>What is Manten Tebu?</h2>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/JW9CP5Jy/Whats-App-Image-2025-04-14-at-12-03-56-jpeg.webp"

            <p>
                The tradition of Manten Tebu is a ritual in which sugarcane stalks are symbolically married before the milling season, 
                offering a compelling example of how societies respond to structural change by creating new cultural practices. 
                Emerging during the colonial expansion of sugar plantations.
            </p>

            <h2>What's the government's reaction to Manten Tebu?</h2>

            <p>The government opened up plantation management rights to the private sector with the enactment of the Sugar Act (Suiker Wet) and the Agrarian Act (Agrarische Wet) in 1870, 
                which caused European entrepreneurs began arriving in the Dutch East Indies to invest their capital, 
                lease agricultural land from the local population for sugar cane plantations, and establish sugar factories.
            </p>

            <h2>Furthermore about Manten Tebu</h2>

            <p>
                In Java, manten tebu illustrates the dynamic relationship between imposed economic systems and the adaptive capacities of local social institutions. 
                By analyzing this ritual through the sociological lenses of economic, religious, and family institutions, as well as functionalist, conflict, and interactionist perspectives, 
                we can understand how new traditions form as a creative negotiation between external pressures and internal cultural continuity.

            <h2>The meaning behind Manten Tebu</h2>
            <p>
                The Manten Tebu ritual is a means of discipline, with the sugar factory owners wielding power and the sugar factory workers being disciplined. 
                Through this ritual, workers are conditioned to work harder, and the harder they work, the more profit the sugar factory owners will make. 
                Machines are a product of technological development that represent a new experience for the Javanese people. The presence of these machines sometimes causes fear among workers.
                This is understandable, given that many factory machines are large and made of heavy metal, posing a high risk of accidents. 
                Fear of these factory machines is still evident in the oral traditions that have developed in communities, especially those around sugar factories. 
                In addition to stories, this fear of workplace accidents is also manifested in symbols, such as when a sugar cane bride, or Manten Tebu, is put into a milling machine as an offering so that the milling machine will not claim any human victims.
